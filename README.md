# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

## âœ¨ About Me

ðŸª¸ My name is Callihan Herrmann and I am currently enrolled in Turing School of Software and Design and will graduate in fall of 2023.  
ðŸŽ“ I graduated from UNC Greensboro in 2018 with a major in Environmental Studies, where I developed a passion for solving complex problems that affect people and the planet. However, I soon realized that I could make an even greater impact by leveraging technology to address these issues.  
ðŸ§© I am currently learning Typescript.  
ðŸ”­ I am currently working on [this team project](https://github.com/lauraguerra1/celestial-cycle) called Celestial Cycle where a user can view their astrological insights with menstrual cycle tracking. Created for WWCode Hackathon for Social Impact 2023. Please feel free to look at all my past projects on my profile here on github!  
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her  
ðŸ‘¾ Fun facts: I am an avid gamer and will often spend my free time playing Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing. Other passions include reading manga, playing with my cats, and raving about tattoos.
