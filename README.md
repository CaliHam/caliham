# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

## âœ¨ About Me

ðŸª¸ My name is Callihan Herrmann and I am a Front-End Developer and recent graduate from Turing School of Software and Design.  
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her  
ðŸŽ“ I graduated from UNC Greensboro in 2018 with a major in Environmental Studies, where I developed a passion for solving complex problems that affect people and the planet. However, I soon realized that I could make an even greater impact by leveraging technology to address these issues.  
ðŸ”­ I am currently working on [updating my portfolio site](https://callihan-h-portfolio.vercel.app/) to reflect my most recent experience working at Astral Insights, LLC as an Associate Front-End Developer.   
ðŸ“± My most recent project I've completed is [Celestial Cycle](https://github.com/lauraguerra1/celestial-cycle) in which I worked with 3 other women to develop an application where a user can view their astrological insights with menstrual cycle tracking. Created for Women Who Code Hackathon for Social Impact 2023. Please feel free to look at all my past projects on my profile here on github!   
ðŸ‘¾ Fun facts: I am an avid gamer and will often spend my free time playing Baldur's Gate III, Stardew Valley, and Animal Crossing. Other passions include reading manga, playing with my cats, and raving about tattoos.
